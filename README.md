-> Although anyone can use the code to automate the process of logging in to their online classes,there is just a couple of basic prerequisites for the code to work:
* Install selenium module
* Download chrome webdriver
* Any text-editor to run the code 
* Don't Forget to change the path(where chromedriver was installed in your system) in line no. 30 and your Reg no and password in line no 98 in the code!
By now, you're all good to go :)
